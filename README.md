# snap4arduino-flatpak

Flatpak of [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.org/).

# TODO

- consider adding the [dependencies](misc/deps) explicitly as sources to the flatpak manifest to avoid the requirement of having an access to the network during the build phase
  - not sure if it is possible entirely to download all the deps as the build process does some downloading besides npmâ€¦
- Put the screenshot on some more stable server than imgur. Upstream website has no screenshots at all.
